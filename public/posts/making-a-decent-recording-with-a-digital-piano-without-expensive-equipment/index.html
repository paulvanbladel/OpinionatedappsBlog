<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I can play the piano but I&rsquo;m not a sound engineer. Because of that, I never invested in decent sound recording equipment (microphones and stuff). Because I don&rsquo;t own decent recording equipment I will never learn how to make a decent recording and become a sound engineer. it&rsquo;s clear, I love playing piano, but I&rsquo;m not interested in the technical details of making recordings.
Recently, I elaborated a very pragmatic and simple process to make a decent recording with a fairly recent digital piano without the need for technical recording equipment.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-need">what do you need?</h2>

<ul>
<li>a digital piano of the new generation</li>
<li>a usb stick</li>
<li>Audacity: Free, open source sound editor
##setting up the digital piano and making the recording
You will need a digital piano which can make a recording to an usb stick directly as a WAVE file (16-bit, 44.1 kHz). Strangly, digital piano companies don&rsquo;t advertise this feature too much. Nonetheless, it is very useful. Obviously, older models can only export music as a midi file, which is completely useless (at least for the purpose we are describing in this article).</li>
</ul>

<p>My <a href="http://www.roland.com/products/hp508/">Roland Hp 508</a> can export to a wav file. Probably other brands like Yamaha support this feature as well.
Read the details in the <a href="http://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/HP508_OM.pdf">user manual</a> on how to configure this.</p>

<p>So, try it out and make a recording.
##the initial result
Simply copy the .wav file to you computer. Obviously, any computer can play .wav files out of the box.
Here is a sample I recorded with my Roland digital piano:
<audio controls></p>

  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
For older browsers: <a href="http://blog.opinionatedapps.com/content/images/BeethovenRondoRolandPianoNoReverb.wav">Beethoven Rondo no reverb</a>
You will notice that the sound quality is excellent, but the sound is rather dry. This we&rsquo;ll solve with audacity.</p>

<p>##adding reverb with audacity
Download <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> and open your .wav file.
Go now to the Effect menu and select reverb:</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not a sound engineer, so I stick to some presets:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2016/05/largeRoom.png" alt="" />
For me the &ldquo;large room&rdquo; preset is the most satisfying.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you own a fairly recent digital piano, making decent sound recordings can be a piece of cake.</p>
