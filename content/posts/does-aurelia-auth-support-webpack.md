##Introduction
Yes is does.
##why webpack?
I like the simplicity of webpack and it seems to load faster than jspm.
Webpack doesn't rely on jspm, nor for the package management, nor for the module loading.
##aurelia-auth on npm is called aurelia-auth.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/aurelia-auth

##how to use it?
I'm using webpack already in my "asp.net core - aurelia - identity server - docker" sample on github.

Jump in the sources and it will become cristal clear:
