##Introduction
I can play the piano but I'm not a sound engineer. Because of that, I never invested in decent sound recording equipment (microphones and stuff). Because I don't own decent recording equipment I will never learn how to make a decent recording and become a sound engineer. it's clear, I love playing piano, but I'm not interested in the technical details of making recordings.
Recently, I elaborated  a very pragmatic and simple process to make a decent recording with a fairly recent digital piano without the need for technical recording equipment.
##what do you need?
* a digital piano of the new generation
* a usb stick
* Audacity: Free, open source sound editor
##setting up the digital piano and making the recording
You will need a digital piano which can make a recording to an usb stick directly as a WAVE file (16-bit, 44.1 kHz). Strangly, digital piano companies don't advertise this feature too much. Nonetheless, it is very useful. Obviously, older models can only export music as a midi file, which is completely  useless (at least for the purpose we are describing in this article).

My [Roland Hp 508](http://www.roland.com/products/hp508/) can export to a wav file. Probably other brands like Yamaha support this feature as well.
Read the details in the [user manual](http://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/HP508_OM.pdf) on how to configure this.

So, try it out and make a recording.
##the initial result
Simply copy the .wav file to you computer. Obviously, any computer can play .wav files out of the box.
Here is a sample I recorded with my Roland digital piano:

For older browsers: [Beethoven Rondo no reverb](http://blog.opinionatedapps.com/content/images/BeethovenRondoRolandPianoNoReverb.wav)
You will notice that the sound quality is excellent, but the sound is rather dry. This we'll solve with audacity.

##adding reverb with audacity
Download [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) and open your .wav file.
Go now to the Effect menu and select reverb:

Again, I'm not a sound engineer, so I stick to some presets:

For me the "large room" preset is the most satisfying.

##Conclusion
If you own a fairly recent digital piano, making decent sound recordings can be a piece of cake.
