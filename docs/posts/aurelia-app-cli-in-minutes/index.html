<p>There is a big revival of Command Line Interfaces (CLI). Windows 10 has today an ubuntu bash shell on board, many application development frameworks promote their own CLI.</p>
<p>Also inside a single page application (a SPA), a CLI can be very useful.
In this post we we look into the functionality of the aurelia-app-cli plugin. In a later post I&rsquo;ll dive deeper into the internals of the plugin.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-my-spa-needs-a-cli-">why does my SPA needs a CLI ?</h2>
<p>A CLI allows a user to execute various tasks when using a CLI.</p>
<h3 id="some-tasks-can-be-executed-faster-via-a-cli">some tasks can be executed faster via a CLI</h3>
<p>Obviously, we build fancy user interfaces because we believe that the typical user experience of a SPA will do things better. Nonetheless for certain tasks a CLI is simply faster than even the most fine-tuned UI. A canonical example is unlocking a user by an admin. Typing in the CLI &ldquo;unlock paulvanbladel&rdquo; is indeed faster than browsing through various screen just to get the same effect. An admin who needs to do this tasks 100 times a day, will be more happy with a CLI.</p>
<h3 id="a-cli-allows-early-preview-and-prototyping-of-functionality-that-eventually-will-have-a-full-ui">a CLI allows early preview and prototyping of functionality that eventually will have a full UI</h3>
<p>Often, new functionality has both a client and server part. When the client side design is demanding, a CLI allows that the server part can be used already and tested in an earlier fase (e.g. for a limited set of users)</p>
<h2 id="features">features</h2>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://paulvanbladel.github.io/aurelia-app-cli-sample/#/welcome">sample application</a> so that you can verify following features.</p>
<h4 id="a-cli-should-look-like-a-cli">a CLI should look like a CLI</h4>
<p>Something like this, right?
Sure, CSS I stole somewhere, monospace fonts and other fancy stuff providing an great CLI user experience.</p>
<p><img src="/content/images/2016/10/app-cli.png" alt="aurelia-app-cli"></p>
<h4 id="a-cli-should-be-self-explaining-and-provide-help">a CLI should be self explaining and provide help</h4>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://paulvanbladel.github.io/aurelia-app-cli-sample/#/welcome">sample application</a> and type in the CLI: help.
You&rsquo;ll get a list of command that can executed. The commands CLS, Help and Welcome are part of the aurelia-app-cli plugin itself. The other commands are &lsquo;project specific&rsquo; to this sample application. The project specific commands are automatically merged with the built-in commands. Which brings us to the next feature:</p>
<h4 id="the-clis-command-set-should-be-extensible-in-a-simple-manner">the CLI&rsquo;s command set should be extensible in a simple manner</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explain that in deeper detail in a next blog post.</p>
<h4 id="a-cli-should-keep-track-of-a-command-history">a CLI should keep track of a command history</h4>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://paulvanbladel.github.io/aurelia-app-cli-sample/#/welcome">sample application</a> and type in the CLI: sum 1 3 and press enter. Press now key up and the same command is displayed.
Currently the history is kept until you type CLS. That will be improved in a later version of the plugin, were I will store the command history in the browser storage.</p>
<h4 id="a-cli-should-never-block-the-main-application">a CLI should never block the main application</h4>
<p>WE run CLI commands as a promise. By doing so, they never block the main application.</p>
<h4 id="a-cli-should-be-able-to-run-multiple-commands-in-parallel">a CLI should be able to run multiple commands in parallel</h4>
<p>The sum commands takes deliberably 2 seconds, so try to run 5 or more and you&rsquo;ll see they run nicely in parallel.</p>
<h3 id="a-cli-should-be-ready-to-cope-with-errors">a CLI should be ready to cope with errors</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://paulvanbladel.github.io/aurelia-app-cli-sample/#/welcome">sample application</a> and type in the CLI: EchoMe &ldquo;hi there&rdquo;. 
We get the expected result. Type now: EchoMe xxx and you&rsquo;ll get an error, nicely colored in red.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-aurelia-app-cli-allows-also-graphical-output">bonus: aurelia-app-cli allows also graphical output</h4>
<p>Normal CLI&rsquo;s running in the operating system can only provide text output. Aureli-app-cli allows also to return graphics.
Go to the <a href="https://paulvanbladel.github.io/aurelia-app-cli-sample/#/welcome">sample application</a> and type in the CLI: GitHubUserInfo paulvanbladel and you&rsquo;ll meet the author of the plugin :)</p>
<h2 id="where-are-sources">where are sources?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paulvanbladel/aurelia-app-cli">aurelia-app-cli</a>
<a href="https://github.com/paulvanbladel/aurelia-app-cli-sample">aurelia-app-cli-sample</a>
In an next post, I&rsquo;ll dive a bit deeper into the internals of this plugin.</p>
